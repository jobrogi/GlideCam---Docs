> **üìå Note:**  
> We have transitioned to a **plugin-based installation** method via the Fab Marketplace. This change was made to resolve reliability issues with our previous import-based setup, which caused frequent asset path errors and inconsistent behavior between projects.  
> 
> After installation through the Fab tab, you can find all included assets under:  
> ```
> /All/EngineData/Plugins/GlideCam
> ```
> This is expected behavior for engine-installed plugins. If you'd prefer to work directly inside your main content folder, you may manually migrate selected assets into `/Game/` ‚Äî or use the included utility tools to streamline the process.
